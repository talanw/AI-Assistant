# Python-Assistant
ECCouncil has introduced a new course on their CodeRed platform: Learn to Create AI Assistant (JARVIS) with Python

The course is good and introduces concepts at a beginner level but what it doesn't do is modulise the overall program. I have attempted to do that here. 

In the root of this folder you should put your SMTPSettings.json file with your SMTP Information in as follows:

{
    "smtpserver": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "smtpuser": "talanw@gmail.com",
    "smtppassword": "supersecurepassword",
    "smtpto": "talanw@gmail.com"
}
